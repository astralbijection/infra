# SSH Keys

This folder contains SSH public keys. See [default.nix](./default.nix) for how they are used in NixOS.

## Intended usage

All SSH keys are to be placed in this folder for use by different tools.

### Deprecation

Deprecated SSH keys are to be placed in [deprecated/](./deprecated/) so that they may be easily removed from servers.

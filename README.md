# Infrastructure

[![Build and check all targets](https://github.com/ifd3f/infra/actions/workflows/check-targets.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ifd3f/infra/actions/workflows/check-targets.yml)

(Note that this README is likely to become out of date very quickly.)

This repo holds everything needed to set up my all my infrastructure, including personal computers and homelab servers. This includes things like:

- Nix configs
- Scripts
- Terraform modules
- Ansible playbooks
- Dotfiles

And so much more!

## Current things I run

This list is not comprehensive and it is likely to expand.

- Multi-cloud system with VPSes in Oracle, Contabo, and SSDNodes
- PC fleet powered by modular NixOS configs
- Self-hosted authoritative DNS using BIND
- An Akkoma server at [fedi.astrid.tech](https://fedi.astrid.tech)
- Centralized monitoring using Grafana and Prometheus
- Automated build and deployment system using a custom Github Actions workflow that is automatically generated
